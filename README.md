## Version History

Alpha 0.1 
    - Initial release
    - Contains lookup only

## Project Plans
- Need bot to respond if it's a blank command on the different arguements that could be added. In what order too
    - Maybe like a .split command on commas and then list them? might help with the word search up too.
- Add possible counter cards
- Add rest of the data for the card such as version, if it's banned .etc
- Add suggestions for synergy
- Make a drafting set up? Might be too much for a bot.
